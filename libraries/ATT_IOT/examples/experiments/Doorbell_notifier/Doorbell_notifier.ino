  AllThingsTalk Makers Arduino Experiment
  version 1.0 09/10/2014
  
  ### Instructions

  1. Setup the Arduino hardware
    - USB2Serial
    - Grove kit shield
    - Grove Pushbutton to D8
  2. Add 'iot_att' library to your Arduino Environment. [Try this guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
  3. fill in the missing strings (deviceId, clientId, clientKey, mac) and optionally change/add the sensor & actuator names, ids, descriptions, types
     For extra actuators, make certain to extend the callback code at the end of the sketch.
  4. Upload the sketch

  ### Troubleshooting
