  AllThingsTalk Makers Arduino Demo Sketch
  version 2.0 dd 25/02/2015
  
  This file is an example sketch to deploy a digital Actuator in the AllThingsTalk.io IoT platform.
  
  ### Instructions

  1. Setup the Arduino hardware
    - USB2Serial
    - Grove kit shield
    - connect a Digital Actuator to Pin D4 of the Arduino shield (example relay)

  2. Add 'iot_att' library to your Arduino Environment. [Try this guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
  3. fill in the missing strings (deviceId, clientId, clientKey, mac) and optionally change/add the sensor & actuator names, ids, descriptions, types
     For extra actuators, make certain to extend the callback code at the end of the sketch.
  4. Upload the sketch

  ### Troubleshooting
  
  for PIN layout on the NodeMCU, check: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/doc/boards.md#nodemcu-1-0
